# Build a Simple Client-Server Network Application

This is a group project for the Software Development in Practice module at the University of Liverpool. 

The group consists of the following members:

1. Chi-Wei Lam (Project Manager & Tester)
2. Maria Petrochenkova (Software Architect)
3. Minh Lay (Software Engineer)


For this collaborative project, we were tasked with developing a simple client-server network application and carrying out several activities relating to the serialisation of data, the transfer of files, and the encryption of data once the network was formed.

## How do I get started?

Ensure that you have installed the necessary packages listed in `requirements.txt` prior to starting.

To install the requirements file, run the following command in your terminal window: 
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

To establish the network, run this command in your terminal window:

```
$ python server.py
```

You have now initiated your server. Open a new terminal window and execute the
following command:

```
$ python client.py
```

Your client should now be connected to your server.


## How to use?

This application will execute using the dictionary object provided. However, should you wish to use 
a different data set or change the data type. Please locate the dictionary object on line 29 of
the client.py file and make the necessary changes.

```bash
my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "city": "New York"}
```

Once the server.py file has been initialised, follow the on-screen prompt to decide how to handle 
the data received from the client.py file.

Similarly, once the client.py file has been initialised, follow the on-screen prompt to choose 
the serialisation format and whether the file should be encrypted.


## Tests

This application ran a basic set of manual unit and integration tests based on the following features: 

```
Our server has three modes:

• Print: only show the content, don’t save

• Save: only save the content, don’t show

• Both: print and save the content
```

```
Our client can send a dictionary object in three different formats:

• BINARY

• JSON

• XML
```

```
Our client has two options for sending files:

• Unencrypted

• Encrypted
```

The table below displays the observed results for all possible configuration combinations:

Please see the test result images along with the functional requirements specification in `/test/`
