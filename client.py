"""
This script creates a dictionary, writes its content to a text file, serialises it, 
encrypts the text file, and sends both the serialised dictionary and the encrypted text file 
to a server using HTTP POST. The user is prompted to specify the pickling format, and whether 
or not to encrypt the text file.

Usage:
    Run the script, and follow the prompts to specify the pickling format and encryption 
    options. The serialised dictionary and encrypted text file will be sent to the specified 
    server using HTTP POST.
